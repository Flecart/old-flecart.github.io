title: Inferential Social Learning
---

This is a theory from developmental psychology. It concerns about how a child is learning from a teacher. I discovered this field with [(Gweon et al. 2023)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2022.0048).
But it is quite difficult to know how this could be useful for machines (not enough technical details about how).

The main idea is that
1. Childrens need to infer about teacher's mental states to learn (I don't know if this is true, but personally I don't think is always true, you can learn with just a book, inferring mental states is not a necessity)
2. Teacher's need to choose the best example.
