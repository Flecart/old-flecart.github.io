#### A brief history

This field was quite developed in 1970 (started in 1920) when mathematicians had the same problem over and over again and needed a name. But this was only the theory. The practical applications came later. A modern use is in machine learning a statistics.

Form historical point of view
- 1947 simplex method popularized by Dantzig at Stanford
- Many people in soviet union in the Â´60 worked on this (they already know about he applications!)
- People in aerospace engineering used these in the '60 to balance loads and stuff like that
- '90 people started using it in communications, like control and signal processing.
