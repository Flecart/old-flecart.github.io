I'm Xuanqiang "Angelo" Huang, Flecart is my Gamer Tag :D. 

I'm a student at the University of Bologna, majoring in Computer Science.
Currently my main interests are in Machine Learning, particularly Deep Learning. 
Examples are **AI Psychology** where we are trying to assess some emergent properties of Large Language Models, and **Logical Reasoning**
examining models through logical tests.
But I'm also exploring other fields such as *Neuroscience* my free time. And tiny bits of reinforcement learning too.

I have also spent some time doing side projects, so that i could learn more about the technologies I was interested in and enhance my technical skills. I have a few projects on my github, but i'm also working on some other projects that i will publish soon!

### Past projects
- [Recipe-generator (2021)](https://recipe-generator-flecart.web.app/) Random Recipe Generator, built with React and hosted on Firebase. This was one of the first projects.
- [Automata-Visualizer (2021)](https://flecart.github.io/Automa-Visualizer) - A web app that allows you to visualize the working of a finite automata, conversions from one automata to another, and more.
- [Bear Game Ai (2022)](https://github.com/Flecart/GiocoDellOrso/releases/tag/v0.1.29) I implemented an AI for the Bear Game (Gioco dell'Orso, local game popular in the alps) using Q-learning ML method.
- [Squealer (2023)](https://github.com/flecart/squealer) -  A web app implementing a Twitter like thread mode, with many many features! e.g. Geolocalization posts, automatic posts, friendship requests, custom reactions and more. It was part of a university project with Web Technologies professor.
