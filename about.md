I'm Angelo Huang, also known as Flecart or Xuanqiang. I'm a student at the University of Bologna, majoring in Computer Science.
Currently my main interests are in Competitive Programming (closely related to Algorithms and Data structures), but I'm also exploring other fields such as Machine Learning and Web Development during my time at university.


I have also spent some time doing side projects, so that i could learn more about the technologies i was interested in. I have a few projects on my github, but i'm also working on some other projects that i will publish soon.

### Past projects
- [Recipe-generator](https://recipe-generator-flecart.web.app/) Random Recipe Generator, built with React and hosted on Firebase
- [Bear Game Ai](https://github.com/Flecart/GiocoDellOrso/releases/tag/v0.1.29) I implemented an AI for the Bear Game (Gioco dell'Orso, local game popular in the alps) using Q-learning ML method.

### Current projects
- [Automata-Visualizer](https://flecart.github.io/Automa-Visualizer) - A web app that allows you to visualize the working of a finite automata, conversions from one automata to another, and more.
