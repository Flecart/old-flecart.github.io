I'm Xuanqiang "Angelo" Huang.

I'm a student at the University of Bologna, majoring in Computer Science. Currently on my last year!
Currently, one of my main interests is understanding human and machine intelligence.
This is a reason why I am trying to assess some emergent properties of Large Language Models (e.g. Theory of Mind).
A recent interest is Algorithmic Information Theory, mainly thanks to Jean-Louis Dessalles's MOOC course!
But I'm also exploring other fields such as *Neuroscience* my free time. And tiny bits of reinforcement learning too.

I have also spent some time doing side projects, so that i could learn more about the technologies I was interested in and enhance my technical skills. I have a few projects on my github, but i'm also working on some other projects that i will publish soon!

### Past projects
- [Recipe-generator (2021)](https://recipe-generator-flecart.web.app/) Random Recipe Generator, built with React and hosted on Firebase. This was one of the first projects.
- [Automata-Visualizer (2021)](https://flecart.github.io/Automa-Visualizer) - A web app that allows you to visualize the working of a finite automata, conversions from one automata to another, and more.
- [Bear Game Ai (2022)](https://github.com/Flecart/GiocoDellOrso/releases/tag/v0.1.29) I implemented an AI for the Bear Game (Gioco dell'Orso, local game popular in the alps) using Q-learning ML method.
- [Squealer (2023)](https://github.com/flecart/squealer) -  A web app implementing a Twitter like thread mode, with many many features! e.g. Geolocalization posts, automatic posts, friendship requests, custom reactions and more. It was part of a university project with Web Technologies professor.
